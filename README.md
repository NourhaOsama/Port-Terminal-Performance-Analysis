# Port-Terminal-Performance-Analysis
The goal of this project is to compare the performance of two ports based on a variety of operational efficiency and productivity metrics. These metrics are calculated using the available data from each port and include berth productivity, crane productivity, vessel turnaround time, yard utilization, truck turnaround time, and more.
